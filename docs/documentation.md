Integrations with Neuroglancer (written in Python) are provided [here](https://github.com/seung-lab/ngl_bench/). The provided code abstracts common interactions with the user interface such as obtaining positional data, clicking, making mouse position changes, and logging in to Neuroglancer, amongst others.

This site provides a quick-start guide for programmatically interacting with the Neuroglancer UI and understanding the different types of obtainable data from NGL. References for the integration code are also provided here.
